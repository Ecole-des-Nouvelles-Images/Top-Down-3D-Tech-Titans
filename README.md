<h2>The Team</h2>
This game was also develloped by a four man crew, The game artists, Maxime Souday and Sacha Nino, and the game devellopers, Elias Prévost and Christopher Barrera, as a project in the course of our second year in our School : L'École des Nouvelles Images
<h2>Main Game Course</h2>
You can have up to 4 players in the crew, when you're all ready, interact with the middle table to launch the game.
<h4>First Phase</h4>
Once this happens you will enter the first phase of your mission, which is to mine the mineral, this is the main objective, and one of you will need to interact with the middle table to complete it.
While the others will be swarmed by a regular course of events, like breachs in the submarin or stations in need of managment, if the breachs are not repared fast water will drowned you and your crew.
If the stations are not in check, they can generate aditional problems, like other breachs, the loss of courant which prevent you from completing the main objective, or your death, in case your out of oxygen.
<h4>Second Phase</h4>
Once you've cleared the first phase of your mission and retrieved the mineral, the second phase, the extract, will begin immediatly, still using the middle table you will need to pilot the submarine to the surface.
In addition of this you are recommended to use the boosters, on the lower side of the submarine to increase your momentum in order to speed up the objective, be wary not to crash on the environmment, as it will cause breachs.
During this second phase, the events are still active and will occur to slow you down, or attempt to end this dive once and for all, work as a team and you should reach the surface, this will end the mission and grant you the win !
<h2>Reccomandations</h2>
We reccomand to play with a full crew, as the difficulty settings are made for this number, this game will require you to have one controller for each player. If you are only 2 or 3 players choose the lower difficulties to start and get
a good grip on the game mechanics, as the last difficulty can get very overwelhming very fast to an experienced group.
