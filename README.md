<h1>Undermining Protocol</h1>
Welcome to Undermining Protocol, a top-down 3D game largely inspired by Overcooked. Dive into the deep waters of various sites to mine and retrieve precious resources in the name of your empire.
Join a four-person crew aboard a submarine and learn to cooperate as you face numerous challenges. Keep track of your oxygen, the submarine's pressure levels, and the condition of all the modules that keep you alive.

<h2>The Team</h2>
This game was developed by a four-person crew: game artists Maxime Souday and Sacha Nino, along with developers Elias Prévost and Christopher Barrera, as part of a project during our second year at L'École des Nouvelles Images.
<h2>Main Game Course</h2>
You can have up to four players in the crew. Once everyone is ready, interact with the central table to select your difficulty and launch the game.
<h4>First Phase</h4>
In the first phase of your mission, your main objective is to mine minerals. One of the crew members will need to interact with the central table to start the mining process. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew will be tasked with managing various challenges—such as repairing breaches in the submarine or maintaining different stations.
If breaches aren't repaired quickly, water will flood the submarine, putting your crew at risk. If stations aren't kept in check, additional problems may arise, including more breaches, power loss (which can prevent you from completing the main objective), or even suffocation due to lack of oxygen.
<h4>Second Phase</h4>
Once the mineral has been successfully retrieved, the second phase—extraction—begins immediately. Using the central table, you'll need to pilot the submarine back to the surface.
To speed up your ascent, make sure to use the boosters located on the lower side of the submarine. Be cautious, though—crashing into the environment can cause breaches, putting the crew at further risk. Events from the first phase will continue to occur, aiming to slow you down or even end your mission. Work as a team to reach the surface and complete the mission to claim victory!
<h2>Reccomandations</h2>
We highly recommend playing with a full four-person crew, as the difficulty settings are optimized for this number of players. Each player will need a controller to participate.
If you’re playing with fewer players (two or three), it's best to start with lower difficulty levels to get a feel for the mechanics, as the highest difficulty can quickly become overwhelming for an inexperienced team.
